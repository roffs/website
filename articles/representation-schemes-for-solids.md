## Boundary representation (BRep)



## Describing the interior

### Space decomposition

The idea of these models is to represent the interior as a collection or the union of cells. There are different families of space decomposition techniques: 
- Uniform decomposition (for example voxelization)
- Hierarchical decomposition (for example octrees)

### Constructive solid modeling (CSG)
It is a binary tree that encode boolean operations applied to primitve objects (spheres, cubes, cylinders...)
